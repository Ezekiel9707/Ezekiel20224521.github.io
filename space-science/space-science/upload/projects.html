								<h1>SIERRA LEONE REDENOMINATES ITS CURRENCY </h1>
								<p>The Republic of Sierra Leone has redenominated its currency, the Leone. The process, which took place on the 1st of July, knocked off three zeros off its old currency, which has been in circulation for decades. Even though there are no real economic benefits to the process, it hopes to make it easier for business people who are used to carrying large amounts of cash. Its government also hopes that the new currency will give investors more confidence in doing business in the West African country.
									The new redenominated currency has the same value as the old one. Previously, $1 equaled SLL13,000. In the redenominated currency, $1 is now equal to SLL13.</p>
