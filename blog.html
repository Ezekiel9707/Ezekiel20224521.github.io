								<h1>A SMARTPHONE "FOR US BY US"</h1>
								<span>JULY 14, 2022</span>
								<p>Nigerian Businessman, Obi Cubana in search of an African who can manufacture a smart phone.
									In a bid to make sure Africa is actively in the forefront of the tech age, Nigerian Business mogul, Obi Iyiegbu popularly known as Obi Cubana has made an offer to any African tech person that can make a smart phone for the African market. 
									Obi Cubana made a pledge to sponsor any African who has the capability to meet the challenge on a video session on instagram.
									In the video, he reiterated his concern on why there are many tech savvy young people in Africa, yet, there has not been anyone who could come up with a brand such as the likes of Samsung, Apple and others.
									The versatile investor promised to use his platform, Cubana Group, as a launching pad for the device as well as funding the entire idea and project. The opportunity will also be a job-creating avenue for many young Africans who are enthusiastic about the tech industry.
									He threw the challenge open to young people who could come up with a phone that has features that could be easily accessible which could be said to be “made by one of us, for all of us”, in his own words. 
									‘I am calling on the Tech-savvy guys. I want somebody that can with an innovation and say, “Obi, I have all the features and more.”

								<h1>GHANA - IVORY COAST COOPORATE ON COCOA</h1>
								<span>JULY 14, 2022</span>
								<p>Last year, Ghana and Ivory decided to finally move away from being competing sellers to signed an agreement for common pricing. One year later, it seems like the strategic decision is now yielding dividends for both countries. 
									In a recent development, the world's top cocoa buyers have now agreed to pay Living Income Differential (LID) to top cocoa producing countries in the world, Ivory Coast and Ghana. 
									The agreement to pay the premium price was made on Friday in order to curb the level of poverty among farmers in that West African region. 
									A living Income Differential (LID) of$400 per tonne will be paid on every cocoa contract done in these cocoa producing countries.
									In other words, it entails that farmers in both Ivory Coast and Ghana will earn 70% of the target market price on a minimum. This means that cocoa buyers will pay a premium to regulators in these countries that will be up to $2600 per tonne.
									According to a joint statement by the Cote d’Ivoire – Ghana Cocoa Initiative (CIGCI) it reads, “Companies in the cocoa value chain have met with the governments of Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana to renew support for the LID as a starting point towards the pathway to achieving living incomes for farmers.”
									Nestle, Blommer Chocolate, Cargill, Touton, Ecom Trading, Hershey, Barry Callebaut, Ferrero, Mars, Olam, Mondelez were all part of the signatories to the new agreement of the Living Income Differential (LID).</p>
